	<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent bibendum facilisis nibh, in dapibus tellus porta congue. Mauris arcu augue, interdum eu gravida in, sollicitudin a est. Mauris semper bibendum tortor, eget ornare dolor lacinia eu. Donec massa lectus, blandit ac tempus tempor, lobortis et metus. Sed a sodales velit. Duis massa erat, blandit sed dictum nec, euismod eget lorem. In non erat id nisl laoreet congue. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec tincidunt tincidunt tincidunt. Integer a lacus nisi, sit amet vehicula arcu. Integer eu est posuere quam imperdiet viverra et at urna. Aenean commodo dignissim luctus</blockquote> Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
